This is the repo that we created to store our game scripts for NightCurator, which is a project assignment for CMPE 316. We used PlasticSCM for version control, then gathered up the scripts and uploaded here for assignment purposes.

NightCurator is a first person psychological horror game which developed in Unity, however it is still far from being ready to release. We plan to improve the game with all its aspects. These files were ready to present a demo.

There are plenty of work needs to be done, such as randomizing spawns and anomalies, improving overall visual and gameplay mechanics etc.

The project members are:
Abdallah Ghordlo,
Fevzi Berk Çeliktaş,
Hussein Abdikarim
